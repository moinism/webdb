WebDB
=====

A JavaScript plugin which make it easy to use WebSQL feature of HTML5. If you are not using this cool HTML5 feature just because it is hard to use then this plugin is for you. AJAX like calls to perform SQL actions.

#### NOTE:

WebSQL API has been deprecated by W3C and is no longer maintained. Browsers's support may drop in future.
I'd highly recommend you switch to better solution like **[ChotaDB](https://github.com/moinism/chotadb)**.

I've re-written this plugin from scratch because it is still really popular and most of the browsers are supporting the API.
